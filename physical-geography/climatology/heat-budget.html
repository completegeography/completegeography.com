 Introduction
The average temperature of the earth overall does not change in spite of continuous supply of sun rays. This is possible only when an equal amount of energy is sent back to space by the earth’s system. In the way there is balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing terrestrial radiations. This balance is known as the heat budget of the earth. The insolation received at the top of the atmosphere is 100 percent. While passing through the atmosphere some amount of energy is reflected, scattered and absorbed. Only the remaining part reaches the earth surface.

Heat Budget
Roughly 35 units are reflected back to space even before reaching the earth’s surface. The details of this reflected radiation are as under:
 Reflected from the top of clouds 	- 	27 units
 Reflected by ice-fields on earth 	- 	02 units
 Reflected by the atmosphere 		- 	06 units
Total 	- 	35 units

The reflected amount of radiation is called the albedo of the earth. The above given radiation does neither heat the atmosphere nor the earth’s surface. The remaining 65 units are absorbed as:
Absorbed by the atmosphere   		-	 14 units
Absorbed by the earth 		 	-	 51 units 
Total   	-    	65 units


Terrestrial Radiation
Radiation of heat from earth’s surface is called Terrestrial Radiation. The long wave radiation is absorbed by the atmospheric gases particularly by carbon dioxide and the other greenhouse gases. Thus, the atmosphere is indirectly heated by the earth’s radiation .
Scattering takes place by gas molecules and dust particles. This takes place in all directions, some of it earthwards and some towards space. In overall, earth receives 51 units of radiation which in turn radiates back in the form of terrestrial radiation. 


The details of this reflected radiation are as under:
 Radiated to space directly 	- 	17 units
 Radiated to atmosphere	 - 	34 units

The details of 34 units radiation absorbed by atmosphere from terrestrial radiations are as under:
 Absorbed directly 								- 06 units
 Absorbed through convection and turbulence 		- 09 units
 Absorbed through Latent heat of condensation 	- 19 units
Total	- 34 units

Total units absorbed by the atmosphere are 48 (14 units insolation + 34 units Terrestrial radiation). These are radiated back into space. Thus, the total radiation returning from the earth and the atmosphere respectively is:

 Radiated back by earth 		-	17 units
 Radiated back by atmosphere	- 	48 units
Total 	-	65 units

These returning 65 units balance the total of 65 units received from the sun. This account of incoming and outgoing radiation always maintains the balance of heat on the surface of the earth. This is termed the heat budget or heat balance of the earth.
