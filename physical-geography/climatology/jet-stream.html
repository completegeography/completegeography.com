Introduction
The strong and rapidly moving circumpolar upper westerly air circulation in a narrow belt of a few hundred kilometers width in the upper limit of troposphere is called jet stream.
The Jet Stream is a geostrophic wind blowing horizontally through the upper layers of the troposphere, generally from west to east, at an altitude of 20,000 - 50,000 feet. 
Jet Streams develop where air masses of different temperatures meet
The circulation of westerly jet stream is contained between poles and 20° latitudes in both the hemispheres at the height of 7.5-14 km
The genesis of the Jet-streams 
Thermal gradient between pole and equator
Pressure gradient between pole and equator
Pressure gradient between surface and subsurface air over the poles
Properties
The circulation of jet streams is from west to east in a narrow belt of a few hundred kilometers width at the height of 7.5 -14 km in the upper troposphere. 
On an average, jet streams measure thousands of kilometers in length, a few hundred kilometers in width and a few kilometers (2-4 km) depth.
Generally, their circulation is observed between poles and 20° latitudes in both the hemispheres. These are also called circumpolar whirl because these move around the poles in both the hemispheres.
 The vertical wind shear of jet streams is 18-36 km/hour, and lateral wind shear is  18 km/hour. The minimum velocity of jet stream is 108 km/hour. 
Their circulation path (trajectory) is wavy and meandering . 
There is seasonal change in the wind velocity in jet streams wherein these become strong during winter season and the wind velocity becomes twice the velocity during summer season. Maximum wind velocity is 480 km (per hour).
Types of Jetstream
On the basis of locational aspect, jet streams are divided into 5 types:

(1)  Polar front jet streams
Formed above the convergence zone (40-60 latitudes) of the surface polar cold air mass and tropical warm air mass. The thermal gradient is steepened because of convergence of two contrasting air masses. These move in easterly direction but are irregular. 

(2)  Subtropical westerly jet streams
Move in the upper troposphere to the north of subtropical surface high pressure belt i. e. above 30°-35° latitudes. Their circulation is from west to east in more regular manner than the polar front jet streams.

(3) Tropical easterly jet streams
Develop in the upper troposphere above surface easterly trade winds over India and Africa during summer season due to intense heating of Tibetan plateau and play an important role in the mechanism of Indian monsoon. 
(4) Polar night jet streams,
Also known as stratospheric subpolar jet streams, develop in the winter season due to steep temperature gradient in the stratosphere around the poles at the height of 30 km. These jet streams become very strong westerly circulation with high wind velocity during winters but their velocity decreases during summer and the direction becomes easterly. 
(5) Local jet streams
 Formed locally due to local thermal and dynamic conditions and have limited local importance.

Index Cycle of Jetstream
Stage - 1
In subpolar low-pressure belt, the cold air from poles and warm air from subtropics converge along a horizontal line
Due to the great thermal contrast and differences in the physical properties, they don’t mix up.
A zone of the stationary situation is created between these two air masses
Stage - 2
Cold polar air is pushed by the easterlies and warm air is pushed by westerlies.
The stationary situation is transformed into an oscillating wave. These are known as Rossby waves
Stage - 3
The jet stream fully becomes meandering and is positioned near the equator. Now the pressure gradient is east-west. There is displacement of tropical air mass to poles and polar air mass to tropical areas.
Stage - 4
 featured by cutting off of the meanders of jet stream from the main path due to very high meandering circulation and it gives rise to several cellular circulation of cyclonic and anticyclonic pattern.
Significance
There is a close relationship between the intensity of Mid-latitude cyclones and jet streams. The cyclones become very strong and stormy when the upper air tropospheric jet streams are positioned above temperate cyclones.
There are fluctuations in the local weather conditions due to changes in the form and nature of ground surface cyclones and anticyclones caused by upper air jet stream.
It causes rapid rate of mixing of air between troposphere and stratosphere, which helps in the transport of anthropogenic pollutants from troposphere to stratosphere.
The monsoon of South Asia is largely affected and controlled by jet streams
