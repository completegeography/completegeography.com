Introduction
 Wind = horizontal movement of air
Currents = vertical movement of air.
Winds balance uneven distribution of pressure globally.
Winds help in transfer of heat, moisture etc. from one place to another.
Sun is the ultimate force that drives winds. Pressure differences force winds to flow from high pressure are to low pressure area. Pressure differences in turn are caused by unequal heating of the earth’s surface by solar radiation.
Factors affecting wind circulation
Since pressure differences are mainly caused by unequal heating of the earth’s surface, solar radiation may be called the ultimate driving force of the wind. The direction and speed of wind are controlled by a number of factors. These are pressure gradient, the Coriolis effect, the centripetal acceleration and friction.

Pressure gradient force
This is the force generated due to the differences in horizontal pressure, and it operates from the high pressure area to a low pressure area. Since a closely spaced gradient implies a steep pressure change, it also indicates a strong wind speed. The wind direction follows the direction of change of pressure, i.e. perpendicular to the isobars.

Coriolis Force
Due to the earth’s rotation, winds do not cross the isobars at right angles as the pressure gradient force directs, but get deflected from their original path. This deviation is the result of the earth’s rotation and is called the Coriolis Effect or Coriolis force. Due to this effect, winds in the northern hemisphere get deflected to the right of their path and those in the southern hemisphere to their left, following Ferrel's Law. The Coriolis force changes wind direction but not its speed.

Frictional Force
The irregularities of the earth’s surface offer resistance to the wind movement in the form of friction. It affects the speed of the wind. It is greatest at the surface and its influence generally extends up to an elevation of 1 – 3 km. Over the sea surface the friction is minimal. Over uneven terrain, however, due to high friction, the wind direction makes high angles with, isobar and the speed gets retarded.

Centripetal Acceleration
Due to inward acceleration of air towards the centre of rotation on the rotating earth, it is possible for the air to maintain a curved path (parallel to the isobars), about a local axis of high or low pressure. It is known as centripetal acceleration.
