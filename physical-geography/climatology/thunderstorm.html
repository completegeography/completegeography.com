Definitions
  Local storms characterized by swift upward movement (updraft) of air and heavy precipitation including both rainfall, hailstorm and squall with cloud thunder and lightning. 

According to A.N. Strahler ‘a thunderstorm is an intense local storm associated with large, dense cumulonimbus clouds in which there are very strong updraft of air.’

Favourable conditions for the formation of Thunderstorm
The atmospheric conditions should be in conditional or convective unstable state.
 The normal lapse rate should be greater than adiabatic rate of temperature change.
 There should be warm, moist and rising unstable air.
 There should be enough supply of moisture from the ground surface to the air.
 There should be greater thickness of cumulonimbus clouds between the condensation level (cloud base) and icing level.
 Enough supply of latent heat of condensation and fusion which may transfer potential energy into kinetic energy which provides strength to the storms.
Stages of formation of Thunderstorm
First Stage
Ground is significantly heated due to solar insolation.
A low pressure starts to establish due to intense upliftment of an air parcel (convention).
Air from the surroundings start to rush in to fill the low pressure.
Intense convection of moist hot air builds up a towering cumulonimbus cloud
Mature Stage
Characterized by intense updraft of rising warm air, which causes the clouds to grow bigger and rise to greater height.
Later, downdraft brings down to earth the cool air and rain.
The incoming of thunderstorm is indicated by violent gust of wind. This wind is due to the intense downdraft.
The updraft and downdraft determine the path of the thunderstorm. Most of the time, the path is erratic.
Dissipating Stage
When the clouds extend to heights where sub-zero temperature prevails, hails are formed and they come down as hailstorm. Intense precipitation occurs.
In a matter of few minutes, the storm dissipates and clear weather starts to prevail.
Classification of Thunderstorm
(1) Air mass thunderstorms
   (i) Heat (thermal) thunderstorms
   (ii) Orographic thunderstorms
   (iii) Advectional thunderstorms
(2) Frontal thunderstorms
   (i) W arm front thunderstorms
   (ii) Cold front thunderstorms
 Thermal Thunderstorm
Originate due to intense heating of ground surface through insolation and resultant rising thermal convection currents.
Heat thunderstorms are real thunderstorms which originate in the afternoon during summer season and die out by the evening.
Orographic Thunderstorms
When warm moist a n d u n s t a b l e air strikes a mountain barrier, it is forced to rise hurriedly along the hillslope.
Advectional thunderstorms
 Produced due to substantial increase in normal lapse rate of temperature and consequent upward movement of unstable air when a cold air underlies a warm air.
Warm frontal thunderstorms
 Produced when sea breezes are more humid and unstable. They are not significant because they are very weak storms. 
Cold front thunderstorms
 Develop along the cold front of temperate cyclones when cold and dense air pushes warm and moist air upward with great force. Since they are associated with temperate cyclones, they are easily predicted.
Thunderstorm and Weather 
Rainfall
 In the form of heavy downpour with greatest intensity of all other forms of precipitation but is of short duration.
Hailstorm
 When condensation occurs below freezing point, ice particles are formed which range from the size of a pea to a large ball. Hail is not associated with every thunderstorm.
 Lightning
It is  produced due to splitting of large water drops.
Thundering
 Thundering sound is produced due to sudden and rapid expansion of air columns caused by intense heat (10,000°C) resulting from lightning strokes.
S q u a l l
 The downward movement and divergence of cold air at the ground surface is called squall.
