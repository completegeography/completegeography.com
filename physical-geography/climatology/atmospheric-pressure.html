A column of air exerts weight in terms of pressure on the surface of the earth. The weight of the column of air at a given place and time is called air pressure or atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric pressure is measured by an instrument called barometer. Atmospheric pressure is measured as force per unit area. The unit used for measuring pressure is called millibar.


Air expands when heated and gets compressed when cooled. This results in variations in the atmospheric pressure.
The differences in atmospheric pressure causes the movement of air from high pressure to low pressure, setting the air in motion. Atmospheric pressure also determines when the air will rise or sink.
Air in horizontal motion is wind. The wind redistributes the heat and moisture across latitudes, thereby, maintaining a constant temperature for the planet as a whole.
The vertical rising of moist air forms clouds and bring precipitation.
Factors Affecting Atmospheric Pressure
There are two main causes, thermal and dynamic, for the pressure differences resulting in high and low-pressure systems.

Thermal Factors
When air is heated, it expands and, hence, its density decreases. This naturally leads to low pressure. On the contrary, cooling results in contraction. This increases the density and thus leads to high pressure.
Formation of equatorial low and polar highs are examples of thermal lows and thermal highs, respectively.
Dynamic Factors
Apart from variations of temperature, the formation of pressure belts may be explained by dynamic controls arising out of pressure gradient forces and rotation of the earth (Coriolis force).
World Pressure Belts
On the earth’s surface, there are seven pressure belts. They are 

Equatorial low
The subtropical highs
The subpolar lows
The polar highs.

Except the equatorial low, all others form matching pairs in the northern and southern hemispheres.


Equtorial low pressure belt
This low-pressure belt extends between 5°N and 5°S latitudes.
Due to the vertical rays of the sun , there is intense heating. The air, therefore, expands and rises as convection current causing low pressure to develop here.
This belt is the zone of convergence of trade winds from two hemispheres from subtropical high pressure belts.
This belt is also called the Doldrums, because of the extremely calm air movements.
Subtropical High Pressure Belt
It exists between 25° to 35° latitudes in both the hemisphere. It is dynamically induced high pressure zone.

The air accumulation is caused by air coming from the equatorial region which descends after becoming heavy. Coriolis force and geostrophic effect are contributing factors for accumulation of air.

Hot tropical deserts are developed in the western side of continents in this zone as subsiding air is warm and dry that discourage rainfall.

This zone of high pressure is called ‘Horse Latitude’ because of prevalence of frequent calms. 
Sub polar low pressure belt
It exists along 60° to 65° latitude in both the hemisphere.

It is dynamically induced pressure belt but thermal factors cannot be ignored. It is a zone of convergence of warm and cold air masses and also known as temperate convergence zone.

Development of fronts as well as temperate cyclone and frequent change in weather conditions are the common phenomena observed in this belt.


Polar high pressure belt
It exists near the poles between 75° to 90° latitude in both the hemispheres.
In this belt, both thermal and dynamic factor operate.
High pressure persist at the poles throughout the year because of prevalence of very low temperature throughout the year.  
The region observes the subsidence of cold and dry air which causes the high pressure. The subsiding air is converted into anticyclone due to the coriolis’ effect and leads to the outflow of air in the form of gale. These gales are known as blizzard in North America and bora in Siberia.
