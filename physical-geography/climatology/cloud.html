Introduction
Clouds are defined as aggregates of innumerable tiny water droplets, ice particles or mixture of both in the air generally above the ground surface.
Clouds are formed due to condensation of water vapour around hygroscopic nuclei caused by cooling due to lifting of air generally known as adiabatic cooling. It may be mentioned that not all clouds yield precipitation but no precipitation is possible without cloud.
Clouds play major role in the heat budget o f the earth and the atmosphere as they reflect, absorb and diffuse some part of incoming shortwave solar radiation and absorb some part of outgoing longwave terrestrial radiation and then re - radiate it back to the earth's surface.
There is wide range of variations in clouds in terms of height, shape, colour and transmission or reflection of light. Baptiste Lamarck is considered to be pioneer in the field of classification of clouds but Luke Howard, an English pharmacist and naturalist is given full credit to present a sound scheme of classification for clouds into main and secondary types in the year 1803. International Meteorological Committee presented a system for naming and identifying different cloud types in the year 1895.
Luke Howard’s Classification
Luke Howard classified the clouds into three major forms (types) and assigned them Latin names as follows: 
(1) Stratus clouds (derived from Latin word ‘stratum’ meaning thereby ‘layer’) are stratified or layered. 
(2) Cumulus clouds (the word cumulus is a Latin word meaning thereby ‘pile’) are characterized by flat base and rounded tops, mound or tower shape like cauliflower. 
(3) Cirrus clouds (derived from Latin word ‘cirrus’ meaning there by ‘hair’) are white in colour and look fibrous and feather like in appearance. These are curly or fibrous clouds.
Classification by WMO
World Meteorological Organisation has classified clouds on the basis of (1) their genesis and characteristic features, and (2) on the basis of altitude of their occurrences.
On the basis of altitude clouds have been classified into high, medium, and low clouds as follows
(A) High Clouds (height, 3-8 km over the poles, 5-13 in temperate regions, 5-18 km in tropical regions) 
Cirrus clouds 
 Cirro-cumulus clouds 
 Cirrostratus clouds 
(B) Middle clouds (height 2-4 km over the poles, 2-7 km in the temperate regions, 2-8 km in the tropical regions) 
 altostratus cloud
 alto-cumulus clouds 
 nimbostratus clouds 
(C) Low clouds (height, ground surface to 2.5 kilometers) 
 strato-cumulus clouds 
 stratus clouds 
 cumulus clouds
  cumulonimbus clouds.
The names have been derived from Latin word where cirro (cirrus) means high clouds, alto means middle clouds, nimbo (nimbus) means rain clouds, strato (stratus) means stratified clouds, cumulus means detached clouds etc


 Characteristic Features of Clouds 
(1) Cirrus clouds (Ci)—The high altitude detached clouds having fibrous (hair like) or silky appearance are called cirrus clouds. They are composed of tiny ice crystals and are transparent and white in colour but have brilliant colours at sunset and sunrise. These clouds are indicative of dry weather. These are found at the altitude of 3- 8 km over the poles, 5 -13 km in temperate regions, and 5-18 km in tropical regions.
(2) Cirro-cumulus clouds (Cr) are white coloured clouds having cirriform layer or patches of small white flakes or small globules which are arranged in distinct groups, or wavelike form. They are high altitude clouds. They generally appear as ripples similar to sand ripples in the desert. These are not common type of clouds.
(3) Cirrostratus clouds (Cs) are high altitude clouds and are generally white in colour and spread in the sky like milky thin sheets. In fact, cirro-stratus is a thin white veil of cirrus cloud. They are composed of tiny ice crystals which refract the lights of the sun and moon and thus halos are formed around them. They are so transparent that the sun and moon are visible through them. 
(4) Altostratus clouds (As) are thin sheets of gray or blue colour having fibrous or uniform appearance. When they become thick sheets the sun and the moon are obscured and they appear as bright spots behind the cloud. They do not form halo around the sun and the moon. They cover the sky partly or totally or are smoothly distributed over the entire sky. They yield widespread continued precipitation either in the form of drizzle or snow.
(5) Alto-cumulus clouds (Ac) are characterized by wavy layers of globular form. They form fairly regular patterns of lines, groups or waves. In fact, they are individual masses of clouds which are fitted closely together in geometrical patterns. High globular groups of alto-cumulus are sometimes called as floppy clouds or wool pack clouds . They appear white or gray in colour. 
(6) Nimbostratus clouds (Ns) are low clouds of dark colour very close to the ground surface. They are so compact and thick (hundreds of meters) that there is complete darkness and there is copious precipitation. Nimbo is from Latin word ‘nimbus’ meaning thereby rainstorm. They are associated with rain, snow and sleet but are not accompanied by lightning, thunder or hailstorm. 
(7) Strato-cumulus clouds (Sc) are of grey or whitish colour. They are found in rounded patches between the height of 2500m to 3000m. They are composed of globular masses or rolls which are generally arranged in lines, waves of groups. They are generally associated with fair or clear weather but occasional rain or snow is not ruled out. 
(8) Stratus clouds (St) are dense, low lying fog-like clouds of dark grey colour but are seldom close to the ground surface. They are composed of several uniform layers. When these clouds are associated with rains or snow, they are called nimbostratus clouds .


(9) Cumulus clouds (Cu) are very dense, widespread and dome-shaped and have flat bases. They are white woolpack cloud masses and are associated with fair weather but sometimes they become thundercloud.
(10) Cumulonimbus clouds are thunderstorm clouds. They show great vertical development and produce heavy rains, snow or hail storm accompanied by lightning, thunder and gusty winds. They appear like mountains or huge towers. Cumulonimbus clouds also produce hail and tornadoes.
