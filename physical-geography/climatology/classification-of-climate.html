Introduction
The climatic classification  involves the groupings of identical weather and climatic characteristics in terms of insolation and temperature, atmospheric circulation and pressure, humidity and precipitation and their influences on vegetation, soil and fauna, of different regions of the world.

The scheme of classification of world climates involves two aspects:

(1) size of areal (spatial) units 

(2) methodology of classification 

Spatial scales for climatic  regions 
The study of weather and climatic elements in an area having uniform conditions of these elements is called regional climatology wherein the size of areal unit grades from vegetable gardens and crop fields to villages, cities, forest covers, deserts, mountains, plains, countries and even to continents.

Based on spatial scale of areal unit M.M. Yoshino has divided the world climates into four principal types 
 micro climate,
 local climate, 
meso climate
 macro climate.
Micro climate 

Microclimate refers to the climatic conditions of the smallest spatial unit having a horizontal extent from one meter to 100 meters and vertical extent from the ground surface to 100 meters upward such as a vegetable garden, a single crop field, a single household, the area around a tree etc.
Local Climate
The local climate comprising a few microclimatic areas covers such spatial unit which has horizontal extent from 100 meters to 1000 meters and vertically extends from ground surface to 1000 meters wherein horizontal differences in climatic conditions are given more importance than vertical differences.
Meso Climate
The mesoclimate incorporates several local climatic areas horizontally extending from 100 meters to 20 km and has vertical extent from the ground surface to the altitude of 6 kilometers. Topographically meso climatic area is homogeneous which is characterized by similar physical controls of weather and climate e.g. the Ganga delta, the middle Ganga plain, Konkan coastal plain, Malabar coast, Tamil Nadu plain, Rewa plateau, Terai region of Uttar Pradesh, Godavari delta, Sardar Sarovar area etc.
Macro Climate
Macroclimate, also known as geoclimatic or geographical climate , covers largest area of all the other three types of regional climate as referred to above. It covers the horizontal distance of more than 20 km (it may be several hundred kilometers) and vertically it extends from the ground surface to more than 6 kilometers. Thus the macro climatic area may cover even the entire continent or a large country like the USA, China, Russia, Brazil, India etc.
 
Approaches to Climatic Classification

Generally, two basic climatic parameters of temperature (mean .monthly and mean annual) and precipitation (both monthly and annual averages) became the basis of climatic classification schemes of early scientists mainly the botanists and geographers.

 Such classification was based on relationship between vegetation, and temperature-humidity as it was conceived that the vegetations of a particular area or region were the function of temperature and humidity conditions of that area. the basis of influences of climate on vegetation types and their distribution is still used for the classification of climates into major climate types.

The classification of world climates based on observed effects of climate is called empirical classification and the approach is called empirical approach.

 The classification of climates on the basis of causes of climatic variations and their explanations is called genetic classification and the method adopted is called genetic approach. 

Classification of world climates involves the inclusion and analysis of numerical meteorological data obtained through modern techniques of weather satellites and radars. Such classification is called numerical classification.
