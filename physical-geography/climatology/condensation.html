Introduction
 The transformation of water vapour into water is called condensation.
Condensation is caused by the loss of heat (latent heat of condensation) 
When moist air is cooled, it may reach a level when its capacity to hold water vapour ceases (Saturation Point = 100% Relative Humidity = Dew Point reached). Then, the excess water vapour condenses into liquid form. If it directly condenses into solid form, it is known as sublimation.
Condensation takes place:
when the temperature of the air is reduced to dew point with its volume remaining constant (adiabatically),
when both the volume and the temperature are reduced,
when moisture is added to the air through evaporation,


Forms of Condensation
The forms of condensation can be classified on the basis of temperature at which the dew point is reached.

Condensation can take place when the dew point is:

lower than the freezing point,
higher than the freezing point.
White frost, Dew, Fog, mist,  clouds etc are example of forms of condensation.

Frost
Frost is defined as transformation of gaseous form of water (water vapour) directly into solid form through the process of sublimation at the ground surface, in the soils, and in the air layer just lying over the ground surface due to condensation occurring below freezing point.
Frost forms on cold surfaces when condensation takes place below freezing point (0Â° C), i.e. the dew point is at or below the freezing point.
The excess moisture is deposited in the form of minute ice crystals instead of water droplets.
Dew
Dew refers to direct deposition of water vapour without hygroscopic nuclei on the surfaces of objects on the ground (e.g. vegetation) after condensation of moist air caused by radiation and contact cooling of air lying over the ground surface.
The air containing moisture to its full capacity, i.e. air is saturated to 100%, or relative humidity is 100%, at a given temperature is said to be at dew point.
It means that the air at the given temperature is incapable of holding any additional amount of moisture at that stage.
The ideal conditions for its formation are clear sky, calm air, high relative humidity, and cold and long nights.
Fog
When the temperature of an air mass containing a large quantity of water vapour falls all of a sudden, condensation takes place within itself on fine dust particles.
Radiation fog results from radiation, cooling of the ground and adjacent air. These fog are not very thick. It is very usual in winters.
Fogs formed by condensation of warm air when it moves horizontally over a cold surface, are known as advection fog. These fog are thick and persistent. Occurs over warm and cold water mixing zones in oceans.
Frontal or precipitation fog is produced due to convergence of warm and cold air masses where warm air mass is pushed under by the heavier cold air mass.
Mist
Fog and mist are both created by water droplets, differing only in their overall locations and density. Fog is a cloud that reaches ground level, even if that "ground" is a hill or mountaintop. 
Mist forms wherever water droplets are suspended in the air by temperature inversion, volcanic activity, or changes in humidity.
mist is less dense and quicker to dissipate when wind, temperature, or relative humidity changes.
Fog is denser than mist and tends to last longer. In terms of visibility, fog reduces it to less than one kilometer (0.6 miles), while mist can reduce visibility to between 1 and 2 kilometers.
Cloud
Cloud is a mass of minute water droplets or tiny crystals of ice formed by the condensation of the water vapour in free air at considerable elevations.
Clouds are caused mainly by the adiabatic cooling of air below its dew point.
As the clouds are formed at some height over the surface of the earth, they take various shapes.
According to their height, expanse, density and transparency or opaqueness clouds are grouped under four types : (i) cirrus; (ii) cumulus; (iii) stratus; (iv) nimbus.
