<h2 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h2><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Atmospheric humidity refers to the content of water in gaseous form in a parcel of air having definite volume and temperature at a particular time and place.</li><li>The content of atmospheric vapour also decreases upward. More than 90 per cent of the total atmospheric vapour (humidity) is found up to the altitude of 5 km.</li><li>The moisture content in the atmosphere creates several forms of condensation and precipitation e.g . dew, fog, cloud, rainfall, frost, ice, snowfall, hailstorms etc.</li></ul><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Types of Humidity</h2><p>&nbsp;Humidity is categories into three groups:&nbsp;</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Absolute Humidity</li><li>Relative Humidity</li><li>Specific Humidity</li></ol><p></p><h4 style="text-align: left;">1. Absolute Humidity</h4><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The actual amount of the water vapour present in the atmosphere is known as the absolute humidity.</li><li>It is the weight of water vapour per unit volume of air and is expressed in terms of grams per cubic metre.</li><li>The absolute humidity differs from place to place on the surface of the earth.</li><li>The ability of the air to hold water vapour depends entirely on its temperature (Warm air can hold more moisture than cold air).</li></ul><p></p><h4 style="text-align: left;">2. Relative Humidity</h4><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The percentage of moisture present in the atmosphere as compared to its full capacity at a given temperature is known as the relative humidity.</li><li>With the change of air temperature, the capacity to retain moisture increases or decreases and the relative humidity is also affected.</li><li>The relative humidity determines the amount and rate of evaporation and hence it is an important climatic factor.</li><li>Air containing moisture to its full capacity at a given temperature is said to be ‘saturated’. At this temperature, the air cannot hold any additional amount of moisture. Thus, relative humidity of the saturated air is 100%.</li><li>If the air has half the amount of moisture that it can carry, then it is unsaturated and its relative humidity is only 50%.</li></ul><p></p><div><h4 style="text-align: left;">3.&nbsp; Specific Humidity</h4><div><br /></div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>It is expressed as the weight of water vapour per unit weight of air.</li><li>Since it is measured in units of weight (usually grams per kilogram), the specific humidity is not affected by changes in pressure or temperature.</li><li>Absolute Humidity and Relative Humidity are Variable whereas Specific Humidity is a constant.</li></ul></div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
