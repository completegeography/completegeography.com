Introduction
Atmospheric humidity refers to the content of water in gaseous form in a parcel of air having definite volume and temperature at a particular time and place.
The content of atmospheric vapour also decreases upward. More than 90 per cent of the total atmospheric vapour (humidity) is found up to the altitude of 5 km.
The moisture content in the atmosphere creates several forms of condensation and precipitation e.g . dew, fog, cloud, rainfall, frost, ice, snowfall, hailstorms etc.
Types of Humidity
 Humidity is categories into three groups: 

Absolute Humidity
Relative Humidity
Specific Humidity
1. Absolute Humidity
The actual amount of the water vapour present in the atmosphere is known as the absolute humidity.
It is the weight of water vapour per unit volume of air and is expressed in terms of grams per cubic metre.
The absolute humidity differs from place to place on the surface of the earth.
The ability of the air to hold water vapour depends entirely on its temperature (Warm air can hold more moisture than cold air).
2. Relative Humidity
The percentage of moisture present in the atmosphere as compared to its full capacity at a given temperature is known as the relative humidity.
With the change of air temperature, the capacity to retain moisture increases or decreases and the relative humidity is also affected.
The relative humidity determines the amount and rate of evaporation and hence it is an important climatic factor.
Air containing moisture to its full capacity at a given temperature is said to be ‘saturated’. At this temperature, the air cannot hold any additional amount of moisture. Thus, relative humidity of the saturated air is 100%.
If the air has half the amount of moisture that it can carry, then it is unsaturated and its relative humidity is only 50%.
3.  Specific Humidity

It is expressed as the weight of water vapour per unit weight of air.
Since it is measured in units of weight (usually grams per kilogram), the specific humidity is not affected by changes in pressure or temperature.
Absolute Humidity and Relative Humidity are Variable whereas Specific Humidity is a constant.
