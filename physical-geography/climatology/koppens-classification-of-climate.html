 Introduction
The German botanist and climatologist Wladimir Koppen presented descriptive scheme of the classification of world climates first in 1900 based on vegetation zones of French plant physiologist Candolle presented in 1874. 
He revised his scheme in the year 1918 wherein he paid more attention to monthly and annual averages of temperature and precipitation and their seasonal distribution. He again modified his scheme in 1931 and 1936.
Classification of Koppen is more popular because it is quantitative in nature as numerical values of temperature and precipitation have been used in delineation of boundaries of different climatic types.

Koppen used the following five major vegetation zones of the world as identified by Candolle in 1874 :

Megathermal zone represents such plants which depend on high temperature and humidity (and rainfall) throughout the year and hence there is no winter season. The plants are evergreen. The temperature of coldest month remains above 18°C. The megathermal zone has the dominance of equatorial (tropical) rainforests having well developed vertical 5 strata.
 Xerophytic zone represents such plants which thrive in hot and arid conditions. Such plants have suitable characteristic features to withstand extreme aridity. Here evaporation exceeds precipitation. The xerophyte plants have their own moisture conserving devices such as long roots, thick barks, waxy leaves, thorns and little leaves. 
Mesothermal zone plants are adapted to moderate temperature and precipitation. The temperatures for the coldest month are below 18°C but above -3°C while the average temperature of the warmest month is 22°C.
Microthermal zone represents such plants which can survive in the region having temperature of the coldest month below -3°C but the average temperature of the warmest month remains above 10°C but below 22°C. Boreal deciduous and steppe vegetations are termed as microtherms.
Hekistotherm zones such plants which thrive on almost permanently ice covered arctic and polar areas, say tundra region. There is perfect relationship between vegetation and condition of moisture in the soils. The characteristic lithosols of this zone (tundra biome) support only lichens and mosses.
Types of World Climate
Based on these five vegetation zones he divided the world climates into five principal types and designated them by capital alphabets A, B, C, D, and E
(1) A Climate represents humid tropical climates characterized by winterless season, warm and moist conditions throughout the year and mean temperature always above 18°C. 
(2) B Climate represents dry climates where evaporation exceeds precipitation and there is constant water deficit throughout the year. 
(3) C Climate represents humid mesothermal or middle latitudes warm temperate climates having mild winters, average temperatures of the coldest and warmest months beings between 8° to 18°, and 22°C respectively.
(4) D Climate includes humid microthermal or cold forest climates characterized by severe winters, average temperatures of coldest and warmest months being below -3°C and above 10°C respectively. 
(5) E Climate includes polar climates characterized by summerless season, average temperature of the warmest month below 10°C.

He also used some small letters for the indication for different climate

f = precipitation throughout the year
m = monsoon climate
 w = winter dry season 
s = summer dry season . 

1. Tropical Rainy Climates (A Climates)

(i) Af climate :
 humid tropical climate, precipitation in the driest month more than 6 cm, seasonal distribution of precipitation more or less uniform throughout the year, very low daily range of temperature.
 (ii) Aw climate : 
tropical humid and dry climate, winter dry season (w), precipitation of at least one month less than 6 cm, high temperature throughout the year. 
(iii) Am climate : 
monsoon climate, one short dry season but sufficient annual precipitation
(iv) As climate:
 dry summers, rarely found.

 2. Dry climates (B climates) :

 Evaporation exceeds precipitation, precipitation not sufficient to maintain permanent stable water table of groundwater. B climates are divided into two types on the basis of annual temperature and the rainiest month of the year 
(i) Dry desert climate (BW)
(ii) semi-arid or steppe climate (BS).
B climates are further differentiated on the basis of annual temperature. When the mean annual temperature is more than 18°C , the climate is indicated by h letter but if the mean annual temperature is less than 18°C, it is indicated by k letter. Thus, B climates are divided into the following four subtypes: 
(i) BWh tropical desert climate, average annual temperature more than 18°C 
(ii) BSh tropical steppe climate, mean annual temperature above 18°C 
(iii) BWk middle latitude cold desert climate, mean annual temperature below 18°C 
(iv) BSk middle latitude cold steppe climate, mean annual temperature below 18°
3. Humid mesothermal  climates (C climates):

(i) C f climate :
 precipitation throughout the year, precipitation more than 1.2 inches in the driest month of summer season. This climate represents Western Europe type of climate
(ii) Cw climate :
 dry winter, 10 times more precipitation in the wettest month of summer season than the driest month of winter season. This represents China type of climate.
(iii) Ca climate :
 Dry summers, three times more precipitation in the wettest month of winter season than the driest month of summer season, precipitation of the driest month of summer season less than 1.2 inches. This represents Mediterranean type of climate

(4) D Climate 
(i) Df Climate :
 humid cold climate, no dry season
(ii) Dw Climate :
 humid cold climate, dry winters,
 
(5) Polar climates (E climate ) :

 Temperature of the warmest month less than 10°C (50°F), further divided into 

(i) E T climate
Tundra climate, of the warmest month of temperature below 10°C but above 0°C 
(ii) E F climate
Permanent snow field, temperature in all months below 0°C
 
Criticism

Koppen gave undue significance to mean monthly values of temperature and precipitation in his scheme of climatic classification and neglected other weather elements.
 He made his scheme more descriptive and generalized and ignored the consideration of causative factors of climate.
 The use of different letter symbols to indicate different climatic types and their secondary and tertiary subtypes makes the scheme very difficult to memorise. 
 Boundaries between different climatic types have been very rigidly determined which is not justifiable as there are a lot of fluctuations in temperature and precipitation from year to year at a particular place.
